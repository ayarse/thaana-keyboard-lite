# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

## Usage

1. Make your changes on a branch
2. Run `bun changeset` to describe the change (patch/minor/major)
3. Commit the generated changeset file with your PR
4. When the PR merges to main, a "Version Packages" PR is automatically created
5. Merging that PR publishes to npm
